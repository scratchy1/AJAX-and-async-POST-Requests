# AJAX-and-async-POST-Requests
Asynchronous (in Ajax) processes incoming requests in a constant event stack and sends small requests one after the other without waiting for responses.
In other words, asynchronous ajax call allow the next line of code to execute,
whereas synchronous call stop JavaScript execution until the response from server.
